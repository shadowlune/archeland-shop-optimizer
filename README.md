# archeland-shop-optimizer

## What's this?

Exactly as the box advertised. I hand-wrote some JSON files for hero buffs and shop items.
I got lazy halfway through and decided to exclude some heroes whose buff values were a bit low.
I got even lazier and decided that I only cared about silver in the shop.

The benefit, of course, is that the performance is fairly snappy.

Requirements are in `requirements.txt`. Python >= 3.10 is needed.
